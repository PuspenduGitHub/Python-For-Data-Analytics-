        "# **Q1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is known as data hiding. This helps protect the integrity of the data by controlling how it can be modified or accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features to the user. It simplifies the use of objects by focusing on what they do rather than how they do it. This allows users to interact with objects through a simplified interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes. Inheritance allows subclasses to override or extend the functionality of the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It supports the ability of different objects to respond to the same message (or method call) in different ways. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding (runtime) or method overloading (compile-time).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Composition:** Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, allowing for a “has-a” relationship. This promotes flexibility and reusability by enabling complex types to be built from simpler ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to create a robust framework for organizing and managing code in a modular and efficient way.\n"

The most recent definition of the method will overwrite the previous ones.\n",
